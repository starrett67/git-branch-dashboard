## Description
A tool to help you manage github branches. Display a list of filtered repos you have access to and manage merges between a filtered list of branches for each repository.

## Inspiration
Working for a company with a linear promotion startegy from dev -> staging -> production for all our backend microservices. Because we have so many projects, I wanted a better way of viewing latest updated repositories and a quick way to create pull requests.
